code for the modular-muse musicBots motor driver boards.

simpleMidiOutput - demonstrates very basic use of the Teensy MIDI library to control a PWM output with note on and note off messages

musicBotsSustain - 5 channel output example that will sustain the motor value until a note off message is received

musicBotsPulse - same as above except will automagically turn the motors off after set amount of time 
                 {typically a short pulse of around 10-20 ms is all that is needed to engage a solenoid)
